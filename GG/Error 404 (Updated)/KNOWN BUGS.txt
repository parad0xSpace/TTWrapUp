When entering the main computer level there is a 80% chance his animations won't work right
they are still there but he doesn't do them, but the fight still works.

Upon starting the game, in the town Jenkins may start yelling at you to get off his lawn when you are not in it,
entering and leaving his lawn once or twice should fix it.
Careful he will run at you and reload the scene if touched.

Sometimes in the boss fight level it wont let you shoot, just drop the crowbar and pick it up again.

interacting doesn't always work properly this is because sometimes the game wants you to be moving as you press E
